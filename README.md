# ESPN Sports Analytics Ratings Impact Analysis

This repo is an ongoing analysis to quantify the effects of analytics on the big four US professional sports teams. The ESPN Great Analytics Rating in 2015 http://www.espn.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/12331388/the-great-analytics-rankings is used. I had to give the Las Vegas Golden Knights a rating of 4 since ESPN never did the rankings again and the NHL decided to expand.

The presentation has been presented at the 2017, 2018, and 2019 INFORMS Annual Meeting and at several MORS Critical Skills for Analytics Professionals (CSAP) courses. It was also presented for the NC State Sports Analytics Club in March of 2019 and at a Meetup.com event in April 2019.
