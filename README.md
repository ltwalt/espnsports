# ESPN Sports Analytics Ratings Impact Analysis

This repo is an ongoing analysis to quantify the effects of analytics on the big four US professional sports teams. The ESPN Great Analytics Rating in 2015 http://www.espn.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/12331388/the-great-analytics-rankings is used. I had to give the Las Vegas Golden Knights a rating of 4 since ESPN never did the rankings again and the NHL decided to expand.
